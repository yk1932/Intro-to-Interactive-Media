The program imports csv file which contains a table. There are 5 rows in total with 8 columns each. Each column contains the angle value for each component. All of the angles in a row add up to 360 degrees. 

The processing program imports these individual values randomly. The rows in which the program imports the data from is programmed randomly using the random() function. These numbers are shown visually as an arc of a circle. Each arc shows a random color which differs whenever the program is launched. All of the 8 arcs together form a pie chart.
