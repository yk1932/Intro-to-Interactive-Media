	This reading was particularly interesting as it made me realize the large extent to which I was influenced by conscious choices made in the design industry. In particular, the example which stood out most to me was the success of the glasses in deviating the product from one of disability to a fashion item by removing the element of invisibility to it. This makes reminded of the reason why I started wearing glasses as a young child. During my initial years in primary school, I had perfect vision like most of the members of my family. However, it was only after one of my best friends got a pair of glasses, the frames of which were turquoise and glossy in texture, my desire to own my own pair of glasses increased. 
	
	I would frequently ask my friend to try on the glasses as I saw glasses as another form of accessories, just like trying out a headband or a bracelet. I regarded it as another way to stylize myself. Doing this frequently eventually lead to a decrease in eye vision which lead me to eventually achieve my goal of owning my own pair of glasses - a decision which I regretted as the years went by. 
	
The design of glasses have also shifted based on trend over the years. In Korea in particular, when I was in elementary school, colorful and glossy framed glasses were what I saw many of my friends wear. As I moved up the grade, people started wearing more of neutral, mostly black, colored frames which would go with any outfit that they were wearing and would not stand out too much. Recently, thin framed glasses, inspired by the 80s, have also risen in popularity. As such, these changes in preference of the glasses' design clearly show that glasses have transcended simply being an object for disability and has gone beyond solely functional.
