I think this reading was particularly captivating my attention as a woman intending to major in Computer Science. What inspired me in particular was Lauren's achievements were not fueled by her intention to prove the society, at the time, wrong but rather the joy she gained from the process. She pursued what she enjoyed and the statements followed through her work and actions. Her tendency to just do, what makes logical sense for her, like the case of adding some features that could prevent a potential error during midflight, is what I find most respectable about her. Her beliefs and ideas shine through her work and the power of action transcends that of words. 

As a person who was born after decades since the birth of software and software engineering, it was fascinating and almost surreal to think about a time where people were indifferent to the existence and the possible functions of a software. It also makes me realize the relatively young age of the field compared to the immense influence it has on every person living during this generation. The versatility of software engineering once again reminds me of my initial interest in this field but also the importance of the direction taken using this powerful tool.
